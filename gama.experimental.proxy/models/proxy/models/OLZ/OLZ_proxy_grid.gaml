/**
* Name: OLZ_proxy_grid
* 
* Every cells of the grid have OLZ (OverLappingZone) that represent a shared spaces with their neighbors,
* When an agent cross an OLZ, a distant copy of that agent is send to the neighbor
* This distant copy will be updated every cycle with the new data of the local agent
* 
* This model should only be launched in headless mode, otherwise it wont work
