	<h1> Overview </h1>
	JACOB is built on windows machines using ANT, most commonly from inside of Eclipse. The main steps for getting a working
	Jacob build are:
	<ol>
		<li>Check out the source code or unpack the source zip file from sourceforge</li>
		<li>Install the Development Environment</li>
		<li>Configure the build by creating a
			<i>compilation_tools.properties</i> file.</li>
		<li>Run Eclipse and load the project into eclipse</li>
		<li>Open the build.xml file in Eclipse and run the default ant target </li>
	</ol>
	<h1> Repository Organization </h1>
	Unpack the source archive zip file or check the files out of CVS into d:\jacob or some other familiar place. Source Java
	and JNI files are located in separate packages from the unit tests and the samples.
	<ul>
		<li>docs: documentation</li>
		<li>jni: c++ code</li>
		<li>lib: libraries needed to compile unit tests</li>
		<li>release: a directory built by the ant script where jacob is constructed</li>
		<li>samples: sample programs</li>
		<li>src: Jacob Java source files</li>
		<li>unittest: JUnit 4.12 unit test programs. Run from the test target in build.xml</li>
		<li>vstudio: some out of date VC++ project files</li>
		<li>bulid.xml: the ant build script. It can be run from inside Eclipse</li>
	</ul>
	The Servlet examples that required j2ee libraries to compile have temporarily been removed.
	<H1>Development Environment</h1>
	The simplest build environment includes MS Visual Studio 13.0 (Studio 2013), Eclipse 4.7 with the C/C++ module and JDK 1.8.
	In that situation, you would just create the
	<i>compilation_tools.properties</i>
	using the example at the top of build.xml as a template.
	<UL>
		<li> Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and it's included library. (to C:\ProgramFiles (X86) in my case)</li>
		<li> Eclipse from www.eclipse.org as the Java IDE.</li>
		<li> Eclipse C/C++ plugin can be used for C coding in place of VC++ IDE.</li>
		<li> Java JDK 1.8 , latest available</li>
		<li> Install the V7.1A libraries available from https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows</li>
	</ul>

	Microsoft Visual Studio 13 supports 64 bit builds. so no additional tools are required.<BR>
	Microsoft changed the location of the windows sdk (formerly known as platform sdk) after VC 8.0. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_SDK
	
	<H1>Build Process</H1>
	The build process is based on ANT. You can run ANT from inside of eclipse or from the command line. Running from inside eclipse
	means you don't have any installation, pathing or configuration to do. You can just open the xml, select the target in the
	"Outline" pane, right mouse and then "run as ant" on the selected target.
	<p></p>
	The ant process is driven off of a configuration file named
	<code>compilation_tools.properties</code> that describes the locations of the JDK and Microsoft C++ tools. The
	<code>build.xml</code> file in the root directory contains examples of the contents of this file. There are two main ant targets.
	<UL>
		<li>"default" executes the following steps when using the default target.
			<UL>
				<li> Build the Java code</li>
					<li> Build the jni code</li>
						<li> create the dll</li>
							<li> create jar file</li>
			</UL>
			<li>"packageRelease" runs the above listed steps and then
	
				<UL>
					<LI>builds the javadoc</LI>
						<LI>builds a source zip</LI>
							<li>builds a binary zip with the javadoc</li>
				</UL>
				</li>
	</UL>
	<H1>Eclipse Java IDE</h1>
		You can open the jacob-project in Eclipse.
		<ol>
			<li>Open Eclipse</li>
			<li>File-->New-->Other...</li>
			<li>Java --> Java Project form Existing Ant Buildfile</li>
			<li>Click "next" to go to  "Create a Java Project from an Ant Buildfile"</li>
			<li>Browse to and select build.xml in the project directory</li>
			<li>Select any of the javac tasks.  This wall cause that one source directory to be added as a eclipse source directory.</li>
		</ol>

	    <p></p>
	Eclipse users have to do some minor tweaks to their project if they want to use the integrated build process. This is because
	the unit tests are files located in the "unittest" directory while the project source files themselves are in "src" the root
	directory. By default, eclipse will add the entire project as source. This messes up the package naming. In addition, the
	build directory should be set to be the same place the ANT build puts the compiled java classes. A couple small tweaks to
	the build path fix these problems:
	<ol>
		<li> Open up the project properties and go to the "Java Build Path" properties panel. </li>
		<li> Remove the root of the project from the build path if it is there</li>
		<li> Add / verify the following folders are in the build path.  Add them with "link source..." if they are missing
			<code>samples</code>,
			<code>src</code> and
			<code>unittest</code> to the build path in the Source tab.</li>
		<li>Add  junit as a library "Add Library...Junit...Junit 4"</li>
		<li> Exclude *.txt from each of the newly added folders. </li>
		<li> Set the default build output directory to
			<code>jacob-project/release/java</code>
		</li>
		<li>Open "Windows-->Show View-->Project Explorer" </li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2> Troubleshooting Build Problems </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Symptom: Build Failed can't find javac compiler. JAVA_HOME does not point to the JDK Problem:
			<br>The java library is pointed at a jre insted of the jdk. Update Project..Properties..Java Build Path to point at the JDK
		</li>
		<li>
			Symptom: The jar is built but no dlls were compiled.
			<br> Problem: compilation_tools.properties does not have the correct location for the Microsoft tools.
	
		</li>
		<li>
			Sympton: Can't find jni.h or can't find C++ compiler
			<BR> Problem: compilation_tools.properties configured incorrectly. Either paths are wrong or the separator is wrong. It requires
			two backslashes for a separator.
	
		</li>
		<li>
			Symptom: Ant fails with the message
			<CODE> Could not create task or type of type: junit.</CODE>.
			<BR> Problem: junit.jar must be copied from this project to the $ANT_HOME/lib directory.
	
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h1> Running Samples and Tests </h1>
	Samples and JUnit test programs can be found in the source jar or in CVS. The programs can be run from a bat file or from
	inside the Eclipse IDE. The java library path variable must be set to include the directory the jacob.dll is in. The simplest
	way to do that is to add it as a command line option. The following assume that your jacob development area is located in
	c:\dev\jacob:
	<pre>
							-Djava.library.path=c:/dev/jacob/release/x86 
							-Dcom.jacob.autogc=false 
							-Dcom.jacob.debug=false 
							-Xcheck:jni
						</pre> JUnit test programs can be individually run from inside eclipse or en-masse via the
	<code>ant test</code> target.
	<h1> Git Bash environment configuration </h1>
	Example environment configuration for windows machine as of 2018/05
	<pre>
							JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files (x86)/Java/jdk1.8.0_161"
							#JAVA_HOME="/c/Program Files/Java/jdk1.8.0_161"
							ANT_HOME=/c/dev/springsource-3.9.4-x64/sts-3.9.4.RELEASE/plugins/org.apache.ant_1.10.1.v20170504-0840
							PATH=$ANT_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
							export PATH
							export ANT_HOME
							export JAVA_HOME
						</pre>
