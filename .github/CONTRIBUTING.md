## How to contribute to GAMA

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug or adds a new feature?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch if you think your addition is worth being included in the release.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution or the new addition. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [gama-dev mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gama-dev) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.
