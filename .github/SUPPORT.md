Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or a **test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Do you have questions about your models?**

* Ask any question about how to use GAMA in the [gama-platform mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gama-platform).
