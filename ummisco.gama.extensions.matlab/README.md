It works with:
- MATLAB 2019a
- Java 1.8_181

To execute the Operator.java file, the Run configuration should contain the following line 
in VM argument:
 
-Djava.library.path=/Applications/MATLAB_R2019a.app/bin/maci64/


TODO :
- replace by an species agent
- set the path at end !
- add the -Djava .... at runtime from Java
- test with various data type
- manage the jar from Matlab (load at Runtime)
